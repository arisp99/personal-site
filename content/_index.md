  I am a bioinformatician at the [Bailey Lab](http://www.baileylab.org/) at
  Brown University. I work on developing software to study the genetics and
  genomics of infectious disease and immunity. In addition to infectious
  diseases, I am passionate about medicine and have actively worked on
  leveraging data analytics to inform local-decision making by physicians and
  showcasing the effect of more holistic and personalized treatment.
