I am a third-year medical student at the UMass Chan Medical School. I am
interested in combining clinical practice and academic medicine to transform
medicine, inform local-decision making by physicians, and homogenize care by
leveraging computational techniques.

Previously, I worked as a bioinformatician at the [Bailey
Lab](http://www.baileylab.org/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/),
developing software to study the genetics and genomics of infectious disease and
immunity.
