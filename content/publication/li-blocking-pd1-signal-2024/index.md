abstract: "
Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with small-molecular inhibitors is a promising
approach for immunotherapy. Here, we identify a natural pentacyclic
triterpenoid, Pygenic Acid A (PA), as a PD-1 signaling inhibitor. PA exerts
anti-tumor activity in hPD-1 knock-in C57BL/6 mice and enhances effector
functions of T cells to promote immune responses by disrupting the PD-1
signaling transduction. Furthermore, we identify SHP-2 as the direct molecular
target of PA for inhibiting the PD-1 signaling transduction. Subsequently,
mechanistic studies suggest that PA binds to a new druggable site in the
phosphorylated PD-1 ITSM recognition site of SHP-2, inhibiting the recruitment
of SHP-2 by PD-1. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PA has a
potential application in cancer immunotherapy and occupying the phosphorylated
ITSM recognition site of SHP-2 may serve as an alternative strategy to develop
PD-1 signaling inhibitors. In addition, our success in target recognition
provides a paradigm of target identification and confirmation for natural
products."
