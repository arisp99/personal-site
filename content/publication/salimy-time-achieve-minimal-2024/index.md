abstract: "
**Background:**
Controversy remains over outcomes between total hip arthroplasty approaches.
This study aimed to compare the time to achieve the minimal clinically important
difference (MCID) for the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome
Score-Physical Function Short Form (HOOS-PS) and the Patient-Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global-Physical for patients who
underwent anterior and posterior surgical approaches in primary total hip
arthroplasty.\n\n
**Methods:**
Patients from 2018 to 2021 with preoperative and postoperative HOOS-PS or PROMIS
Global-Physical questionnaires were grouped by approach. Demographic and MCID
achievement rates were compared, and survival curves with and without
interval-censoring were used to assess the time to achieve the MCID by approach.
Log-rank and weighted log-rank tests were used to compare groups, and Weibull
regression analyses were performed to assess potential covariates.\n\n
**Results:**
A total of 2,725 patients (1,054 anterior and 1,671 posterior) were analyzed.
There were no significant differences in median MCID achievement times for
either the HOOS-PS (anterior: 5.9 months, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6 to
6.4; posterior: 4.4 months, 95% CI: 4.1 to 5.1, P = .65) or the PROMIS
Global-Physical (anterior: 4.2 months, 95% CI: 3.5 to 5.3; posterior: 3.5
months, 95% CI: 3.4 to 3.8, P = .08) between approaches. Interval-censoring
revealed earlier times of achieving the MCID for both the HOOS-PS (anterior:
1.509 to 1.511 months; posterior: 1.7 to 2.3 months, P = .87) and the PROMIS
Global-Physical (anterior: 3.0 to 3.1 weeks; posterior: 2.7 to 3.3 weeks, P =
.18) for both surgical approaches.\n\n
**Conclusions:**
The time to achieve the MCID did not differ by surgical approach. Most patients
will achieve clinically meaningful improvements in physical function much
earlier than previously believed."
