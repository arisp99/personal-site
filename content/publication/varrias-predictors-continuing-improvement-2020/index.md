abstract: "
**Background:** Women have been under-represented in major randomized
resynchronization clinical trials and constitute 13-31%. Previous studies show
greater benefit of CRT in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n\n
**Objective:** We aim to investigate the improvement in cardiac function and
performance at 3 different time points after implantation of a CRT device in
women.\n\n
**Methods:** We reviewed 200 CRT devices implanted in women between 2004 and
2016 receiving multidisciplinary care in Massachusetts General Hospital. Patient
functionality assessment was performed using surrogates of cardiac function:
LVEF, NYHA class, Six-minute walk, Minnesota living with heart failure
questionnaire (MLHFQ).\n\n
**Results:** A multivariate regression model did not show any independent
association with favorable cardiac remodeling or functionality assessment
improvement during the 1st month of CRT in women. However, our analysis showed
that women without COPD (p=0.015) and with non-ischemic type of cardiomyopathy
(p=0.009) present with excellent response after the 1st month of CRT. They
presented an increase of 34% in distance covered during the 6-minute walk test,
(3% decline for those with ischemic HF) and an average decrease of 0,4 in their
NYHA classification system (0.1 decrease for those with ischemic HF). These
results were significant for the 6 min walk (R2= 0.3869) and marginally
significant for LVEF and NYHA status. Age, hypertension and atrial fibrillation
were not associated with poor response.\n\n
**Conclusion:** Women with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and absence of COPD keep
improving after the 1st month of implantation, while ischemic and COPD patients
tend to decline or stabilize depending on the surrogate."
